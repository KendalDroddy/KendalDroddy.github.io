            <h3 class="section-header">Basics of Malware</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The word malware is a concatenation of the individual words 'malicious' and 'software'. This term encompasses a wide variety of software, all of which has malicious end goals. In contrast to software a user would knowingly install on their device, malware is placed on a device through deceptive, and sometimes illegal methods. So, what is the driving factor behind this type of behavior?</p>
            <p class="text-justify">There are quite a few motivating factors behind malware. The most common is for financial gain. Data breaches containing user info as well as credit card numbers and credentials is, unfortunately, a regular occurrence. Aside from attacks at the corporate level, malware can be targeted at individual credit card readers such as at a gas station pump or ATM machine. This reinforces the need to be educated about how malware works and how to detect it. Other motivating factors include political purposes, other forms of organized crime, and even research or experimentation just to see how a system can be exploited.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Multiple categories of malware exist including:
            <ul>
              <li>Viruses</a></li>
              <li>Trojans</a></li>
              <li>Potentially Unwanted Software (PUP)</li>
            </ul> 
            A <strong>virus</strong> is considered parasitic - it is dependent upon another file in the user's system. This 'host' must then be executed which serves as a trigger for the virus to also executed. More advanced viruses can also be of the <strong>polymorphic</strong> variety. This means that their code is constantly changing. The result is a virus that is very difficult to pinpoint, analyze, and kill because it is always found in varied states.</p>
            <p>A <strong>Trojan</strong> is a form of malicious software named after the Trojan horse of Greek mythology. Look up the story to learn more - but essentially the Trojan disguises itself as something else in order to gain access to the user's system. The Trojan may look like a useful application, a game, any other number of things a user would be open to downloading. In an ironic manner, Trojans may even be disguised as anti-virus software! Once the user's system is breached, a Trojan can log the system's keystrokes, hold the device ransom for money, or use the system as a bot.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">A <strong>Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)</strong>is something that the user likely gave consent to download even though its something they don't actually want. In some cases they downloaded another program and in the process, gave consent for that program to add the PUP to their device. Two common PUPs come in the form of <strong>adware</strong> and <strong>spyware</strong>.Adware monitors the user's activity in order to target advertisements specifically tailored to their interests. Spyware similarly monitors activity, but it uses this information for purposes broader than advertising.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Understanding these forms of malware and how they work is the first key to defending against them. The next step is to actually examine live malware samples in a lab environment to gain hands on experience with their behaviors and tendencies. Several tips are provided for doing just that. First, malware samples should be transported in an inactive state. If the sample uses a specific file extension, then rename it until it is ready to use. Second, the testing environment should be completely locked down. This could include the use of anti-malware programs, firewalls, and specific policies to protect the environment. Lastly, be ready to completely disconnect from internet at a moment's notice.

            <h3 class="section-header">Advanced Forensics</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This week we dove into some more advanced forensics with a particular emphasis on evidence acquisition. A quote from an early lecture set the ground work for week: "Forensic computing is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legally acceptable." In laymen's terms, the job of a forensic investigator is not to prove whether or not someone is guilty or innocent. The job is prove what exactly happened on the system in question as accurately as possible. A declaration of innocence or guilt is a job left for the judge and jury.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The various aspects of the job of a forensics investigator can be summed up in three words:
              <ul>
                <li>Acquisition</li>
                <li>Investigation</li>
                <li>Reporting</li>
              </ul>
            While fairly self explantory, each of these components is packed with various layers of understanding. Acquisition is the gathering of evidence. It sounds simple but there are a number of considerations to take into account. For example, it's possible that the target system is located in an active crime scene. Speed is of the essence as the police may only allow you a very short amount of time to gather the data. In another case, the target system may contain multiple terabytes of data that must be gathered. How can this be done in an effective way that preserves the accuracy of the data?</p>
            <p>Another consideration regarding evidence acquisition is the fact that evidence can exist on a wide variety of layers within a system. A number of those discussed in class include:
              <ul>
                <li>Network</li>
                <li>Operating System</li>
                <li>Database</li>
                <li>Peripherals</li>
                <li>Removable Media</li>
              </ul>
            Each of these comes with its own set of challenges with respect to data gathering. An investigtor must be familiar with each of its pecularities and how to deal with them.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Once acquired, the evidence must then be carefully disected and investigated. The investigator must be equipped with a variety of tools and know how to use each of them to understand the data being examined. Hands-on examples were given in class allowing us to utilize tools such as FTK Imager to examine data. Another key aspect of investigation is to form a very accurate timeline of events. This can be done by diggint into time stamps or system logs and is very helpful is reconstructing a malwre attack. It can also be useful for triage. That is, proving the same conclusion in multiple different ways. By developing an accurate timeline, it is much easier to prove certain events and disprove others.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the evidence must be reported. While some investigators have transitioned to electronic means for reporting, this is largely still done with paper and pen. Again, noting the time of specific events is key for reporting. This ensures that no doubt remains as to what happened and when. It is also important to communicate clearly in the report. Many times very technical terms and events will need to be explained to people, possibly a judge or jury, with little to no technical background. Everything must be explained in a way that they can understand.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">There's one more concept that should be noted this week and that is the <strong>order of volatility</strong>. This refers to the specific order in which data and evidence should be collected. By volatile I mean the least stable - the evidence that is most likely to become corrupted, be lost on the network, or even erased from a hard drive never to be seen again. Taken from Darril Gibson's Security+ book, the order of volatitiy is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>Data in cache memory</li>
                <li>Data in RAM</li>
                <li>A paging file</li>
                <li>Data stored on local disk drives</li>
                <li>Logs stored on remote systems</li>
                <li>Archive media</li>
              </ul>
            This list is shown in order of decreasing volatility. An investigator should start by gathering data from the top of the list and then proceed down.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">Malware Defense</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The previous week's lectures supplied us with a great deal of information about malware. Topics ranged from an overview of malware and what it does, to a deeper understanding of malware including how it should be handled and analyzed. This week we shifted gears a bit. Understanding malware is great, but now that we know what it does and how it acts, what can we do to defend against it?</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The question seems simple at first but its apparent that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. We've already learned that there are millions upon millions of malicious attacks floating about the web. It's not possible to stop or even defend against everything. However, one step we can take to assist in this is to place malware under four broad umbrellas that characterize their execution. In order, these steps are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>First Contact</li>
                <li>Local Execution</li>
                <li>Establish Presence</li>
                <li>Harvest Information</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">Step one is pretty straightforward. First contact is the means by which the user is initially exposed to malicious software. This takes a variety of forms but most commonly includes email or instant messages, misuse of physical media, or even poisoned search results. Looking more closely at the email example - most companies have policies in place to protect their users from malicious emails. This often includes training on how to identify and handle suspicious emails. But there's always a case where a curious user opens an untrusted email or even downloads an attachment from a suspicous email.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">By doing so, the user has fallen prey to the malware's first contact. The malware was opened and is now moved to the second stage - local execution. Sometimes this may happen automatically. But sometimes it may require the user to perform an extra step. Maybe the malware tricks the user into running an executable. Regardless of the method, this stage is when the malware executes the malicous portion of its code.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">With the malware now executed, it will next seek to establish presense on the host machine. This is where the malware gets to work really entrenching itself and spreading its roots. This may take several forms, the first of which is downloading and installing additional malware. This can cause a chain reaction resulting in tens or even hundreds of separate pieces of malicious software installed on the host. A second technique involves propgation to another system. Picture a secenario in which one machine in a large company is infected. Then, through file copying or network exploitation, that malware infects all the other machines in the company! One more way for malware to establish presence is through self-preservation. In this scenario the malware takes specific steps to protet itself. One common way this is done is through the disabling of security software or updates that would detect and disable the malware.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">At this point the malware has made contact with the host, executed locally, and established its presence. Now it's time to go into the malicious activity. It's not uncommon to hear about large data breaches and this is one specific area that malware targets: capturing sensitive data. A keylogger or man-in-the-browser attach may be used to capture information. This data can in turn be used for identity theft or financial fraud. It can also take the form of adware. If you've ever downloaded something from the web only to find a dozen toolbars added to your browser, you may have been exposed to this type of attack. In some cases these toolbars or ads can be clicked which triggers another malicioius event.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Turning to malware defense we covered several popular technologies in use today. But the best way to categorize the entire approach describe would be <strong>defense in depth</strong>. This is a common security practice in which multiple layers of protection are implemented to provide a stronger defense structure. This method is explored in more detail in Darril Gibson's Security+ textbook and includes two parts: <strong>control diversity</strong> and <strong>vendor diversity</strong>. Control diversity relies on implementing a wide variety of security control types. These may come in the form of administrative, technical, and physical controls. Practical examples include locked or secured rooms, firewalls & intrusion detections tools, and penetration testing. Vendor diversity is another method for adding layered defenses to the overall security plan. An exploit that may exist in one vendor's firewall may be protected by another vendor's firewall. The result is a combined firewall solution that is more difficult to penetrate. Altogether, vendor and control diversity allow for a strong layered defense that is much more secure than any single solution on its own.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">Vulnerabilities & Exploits</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This week our attention turned to vulnerabilities and exploits. It's important to understand what these words mean and how they relate. As defined by Darril Gibson a <strong>vulnerability</strong> is a weakness or flaw in a system. It is at these particular weak points that appeal to hackers trying to break. They specifically target these areas and attempt to <strong>exploit</strong> them. By exploiting a vulnerability it actually becomes a breach of the system and can then be use for malicious purposes. This highlights the fact that hacking often means thinking outside of the box. It means getting inside the mind of the developer, and finding out what they missed on the security side of things. This could mean finding a bug on a webpage that can be used to alter the behavior of the page. Or it could be taking advantage of a system that is not configured properly or was created using poor programming practices. There are many scenarios that fit the bill but these are just two examples.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Another important bit of information to note is that attackers are shifting their focus. In past years it was the case that they targeted perimeter defenses such as routers or firewalls. Companies protected themselves by employing defense in depth. This is a topic that I discussed at length in my previous post. The attackers needed to adapt to this strategy. In doing so, their focus shifted to the user. Specifically, they looked to exploit the user - the most common target being the user's browser. To help combat these exploits, companies began offering bug bounties. One example is the Samsung Bug Bounty program. They will reward someone anywhere from $200 to $200,000 for find a legitimate bug. The reward depends on the severity level.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The first type of attack discussed in class was the <strong>buffer overflow</strong>. An overflow occurs when a system application receives more data than it is capable of properly handling. The excess data spills out essentially, and the result is that the system's memory is exposed. In this attack, the buffer refers to the memory that the application normally has access to. The overflow references the memory that is outside of this application's own scope, which is now completely exposed. At this point, the exposed memory is only classified as a vulnerability. It is not until the attacker does something malicious with it that it becomes an exploit.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The buffer overflow attack can be broken down into several steps. In the example in class this begins with crash triage. The main things to find out here are what do we control and where are we in the execution of the code. Essentially this is figuring out the vulnerability - how was the crash caused and how can it be repeated and exploited. Next, we need to find out the return address offset. This lets us know how many bytes we have to work with. We can then position our shell code. <strong>Shell code</strong> is what we call the specific set of instructions that we craft and inject into the application - it is the executable portion of this attack. Now just because the shell code is placed in memory doesn't mean it will automatically trigger. This brings up the last step which is finding the address of the shell code. Several techniques are described in detail to get us to the shell code. Once there, the code executes and the calculator pops up! Of course, in the real world something much more nefarious would likely happen!</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The second attack described is called <strong>use after free</strong>. I won't go into as much detail because it's similar in concept to the previous attack. The main difference is that this attack targets the heap, while the previous attack targets the stack. In use after free, first an object must be freed from memory. This freed object is now replaced with an object of our own. Special care must be taken here to ensure the object is the same size as that which was freed. The shell code is then positioned and the ojbect is used again, triggering the shell code.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">Windows Memory Manipulation</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This week our attention turns to memory manipulation in Windows machines. It is sometimes the case that attackers will use hidden files to exploit a machine. So this week's goals are twofold:
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the concepts of stealth by means of memory manipulation.</li>
                <li>Debug and explore various stealth techniques</li>
              </ul>
              The first topic discussed was kernel memory. Several key points were made here. First, kernel memory is a flat memory model with no security operations. If an attacker can get to that level of memory then the defender has no advantage - they are fighting on the same plane. Next, any kernel can access and part of memory. This makes access to the kernel very appealing and powerful. And lastly, the kernel as a whole is comprised of the Windows kernel and the driver. At this point we also took a brief look at <strong>hooking</strong>. Let's say we have two machines, A & B, with A sending packets to B. An attacker then hooks into this data stream, filters the contents, takes what they are seeking and sends that data to a new, separate machine, and then let's the remaining data pass through.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Understanding kernel memory manipulation also requires an understanding of threads and how they work. Simply put, a <strong>thread</strong> is the smallest unit of execution within an operating system. Different applications may have multiple jobs that need to be processed. These can be broken down into individual processes, each with its own thread. The thread scheduler then loads these jobs into the CPU, prioritizes them, and executes the process. These processes can be examined using the <strong>Process Hacker</strong> tool as discussed in lecture. This allows the user to view all the current processes, the drivers or applications they are associated, and their individual permissions (read, write, and execute). These processes can be analyzed to see if malware is generating any new malicious processes. A clear indiciation that this is the case is when a private, unnamed processes is generated that has execute permissions.</p>
